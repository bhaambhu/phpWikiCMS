# phpWikiCMS

A framework that allows you to easily create a wiki style page management system, supports tree-style relationships and their management and viewing.

# Disclaimer

I made this project in 2017 but I am rebasing the commits and pushing it to github in December 2022 (that's what the commit dates above reflect).

This project is poorly structured - Since php is kinda dead now, I didn't do any effort to restructure or improve this project using any of my knowledge and experiences that I've gained over the years after making this project, but someone could maybe find this project useful so I'm putting this on github.

# The Core

Whatever knowledge you want to store for any topic, just write it into the editor. While writing a piece of knowledge if you happen to write complicated terms that need to have their own page/topic, just surround them with [[double brackets]]. This will make a temporary empty topic/page, which will only consume storage space once knowledge is added to it. To make a fancy link simply write [[topicName | textToDisplay]], this allows for a different topic name and the link title to display in the current page.
